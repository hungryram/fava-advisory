                Parrish is the definition of a consummate professional. With
                less than 12 hours notice, he arranged an offer for me in my
                dream building and diligently pursued the listing. Within 24
                hours, we had an accepted offer. Due to his tenacity,
                understanding of the market and natural drive, Parrish is the
                only salesperson I will work with in NYC to list, sell or lease.

                Parrish always makes you feel like you’re his number 1 priority.
                Parrish is the type of real estate agent that is able to remain
                professional while also making the entire experience fun and
                stress free\! Throughout the entire process, Parrish kept a
                clear line of communication and was completely transparent with
                us about all of the properties he was showing us. Parrish took
                everything we asked for and was able to find us a home that had
                everything we wanted and more. He was always one step ahead of
                us and always had the answers to our questions or he was doing
                everything he can to get us those answers. Ever since working
                with Parrish, I’ve recommended him to everyone who is even
                considering moving in the near future, and I will continue to do
                so\!

                them. If you’re looking for a new place to live, Parrish is the
