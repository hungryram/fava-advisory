Born and raised in the Netherlands and London, Maryse did not fall into real estate coincidentally. Passionate about real estate her whole life, she made the decision to become a real estate broker at the early age of 18 and honed her skills while studying real estate at Hogeschool Rotterdam. After graduation, Maryse was an integral part of the real estate division of Ernst & Young in the Hague and Amsterdam. She used this experience to further broadened her industry expertise by adding legal and valuation skills, most notably by working on valuations for luxury hotels and real estate investment companies. After her time at EY, Maryse continued her career at the top brokerage firm Eefje Voogd Makelaardij in the Netherlands, ranked number one nationwide in new developments. There she worked as a top broker and managed a team of several agents for over six years, specializing in new development sales. 

After more than a decade of International sales experience, Maryse moved to New York to pursue bigger dreams while enjoying all that the city has to offer. Maryse prides herself on her Dutch-directness, strong work ethic, integrity, and believes that being a great listener is key to finding the perfect property for her clients. For those looking for a dedicated agent with expertise, experience and strong negotiation skills, look no further.
