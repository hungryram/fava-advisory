A one-of-a-kind duplex condo nestled in the heart of NoLita, this 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom home is a masterpiece of urban luxury and design. Originally laid out with 4 bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms, the home has been highly customized and upgraded over time.

Features of this 4,078 sq. ft. apartment include gorgeous white oak flooring, soaring 23-foot ceilings, custom light fixtures and millwork, a wood-burning fireplace, large sash windows, a convenient in-home laundry room with a side-by-side washer/dryer and utility sink, a pair of private parking spaces, a keyed storage room, and a 990 sq. ft. terrace with a pergola and gas grill.

Beyond a tasteful foyer adorned with a coat closet and a powder room, the lower level of the home flows into a cavernous living and dining space saturated with natural light. The room possesses a 23-foot double-height ceiling as well as a stunning wood-burning fireplace with a floor-to-ceiling travertine marble surround. Just off the dining area is a regal study with custom built-ins and a hidden door leading to the laundry room. Opposite the living and dining space are an incredible Smallbone of Devizes kitchen and a bedroom/den with an en-suite steam room and shower. The kitchen leads out onto the terrace and is equipped with a huge eat-in waterfall island, polished statuary marble countertops, a Bardiglio mini bricks backsplash, and a suite of fully-integrated stainless steel appliances from Gaggenau.

The upper level of the home contains a pair of bedrooms and bathrooms. The decadent master suite boasts his-and-hers walk-in closets, a private lounge area, and a chic en-suite bathroom with mosaic-tiled floors, double sinks, Barber Wilson fixtures, a glass-enclosed walk-in shower, and a deep soaking tub. The second bedroom has its own reach-in closet and easy access to an immaculate full bathroom. Both bedrooms overlook the terrace and have Venetian plastered walls as well as airy 10-ft ceilings.

224 Mulberry Street is a boutique condominium located in the exclusive neighborhood of NoLita. The building has a 24-hour doorman, a fitness center, and private rooftop terrace with breathtaking views of the city skyline. It is surrounded by trendy restaurants, cafes, bars, and shops, and is close to Sara D. Roosevelt Park, SoHo, NoHo, LES, and Greenwich Village.
