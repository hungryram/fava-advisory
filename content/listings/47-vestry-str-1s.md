Boasting 19th Century details and a prime Tribeca location, this 2 bedroom + home office, 2 bathroom co-op is a seamless blend of contemporary luxury and old world charm. Features of this 2,400 square foot home include beautiful hardwood floors, airy 13.5-ft ceilings, impressive closet space, an in-unit washer/dryer, central air controlled by a voice-controlled Nest system, voice-controlled Lutron Caseta lights, exposed brick walls and original timber support beams, a private storage unit and extremely low carrying costs.

A welcoming foyer and gallery adorned with large coat closets and a full bathroom flow into a spacious open-concept living room, dining room, and kitchen. The kitchen is equipped with a huge eat-in island, sleek Corian countertops, custom cabinets, and a suite of high-end stainless steel appliances from Miele. Just off the living area is a library/home office that could easily be used as a sleeping area. The primary bedroom possesses a massive walk-in closet and a pristine en-suite bathroom, and the large second bedroom has easy access to a second full bathroom with a shower stall and a deep soaking tub.

47 Vestry is a boutique co-op nestled amongst the cobbled streets of Tribeca North Historic District. The building is surrounded by trendy restaurants, bars, cafes, galleries, and shops, and is close to Piers 25 and 26 on the Hudson River Greenway. SoHo and Greenwich Village are also just a few blocks away.
