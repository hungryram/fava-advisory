## Lower Fifth Avenue Masterpiece. 
Completely gut renovated and customized from top to bottom, this exceptional oversized one bedroom has everything you need in a home: In-unit washer/dryer, custom California closets, 7” grey oak plank flooring, brand new electric wiring with custom electric shades, Lutron Grafik T switches, brand new PTAC units complete with ecobee wireless AC control, and last but certainly not least…room for a home office or Peloton\!

Open southern views of both Greenwich Village and blue sky are rare to find, but this home also features dual exposure which provides optimal light to both bed and living rooms. The bedroom boasts another large closet and fits a king size bed comfortably with enough room for a desk or sitting area. The windowed kitchen is outfitted with Dekton countertops and sleek black stainless steel Samsung appliances (including a TV screen fridge) and the bathroom features a pristine standing shower with Kohler fixtures and Toto toilet.

A mere two blocks north of Washington Square Park, the Brevoort is one of the Gold Coast’s premier cooperatives. Amenities include 24-hour doorman and concierge service, resident manager, circular driveway off of Fifth Avenue, grand lobby with gardens, lobby-level gym, parking garage, bike room, on-site laundry and a storage unit for each apartment. The building has recently been upgraded with many eco-friendly green features including new windows, planted rooftops and supplemental emergency power. Incredibly central downtown location is close to amazing dining, shopping and entertainment options, as well as nearly every public transportation option within a few blocks. Pets, pieds-a-terres and parents purchasing for adult working children are permitted with board approval.
