                Scott has delivered for me time and time again. The sale of my
                last 'AIR loft' in SoHo was easily one of the most difficult
                feats in the history of sales in NYC real estate. He
                consistently brought through qualified prospective buyers and
                dealt with an impossibly difficult board. He never showed up
                with anything less than an extremely positive attitude and
                perseverance. I've recommended him to multiple friends and
                associates and will continue to do so.

                We have worked with the Fava Advisory on three transactions (two
                purchases and one sale) and continue to recommend Scott and his
                amazing team to other friends. Scott has keen knowledge of the
                markets as well as numerous developer contacts, which in our
                case led to us see our apartment before it was officially
                listed. Scott has high integrity and sets realistic expectations
                for purchase and sale prices so as not to mislead his clients.
                He also conducts himself in an extremely professional and detail
                oriented manner. Scott's fees have paid for themselves multiple
                times over in the form of real estate price appreciation.

                I worked with Scott in late summer 2015 to list my apartment for
                sale (after previously working with him to purchase it back in
                2006) and to help me purchase a new apartment. The apartment I
                wanted to purchase already had an accepted offer so right out of
                the gates I was able to appreciate his ability to get me in to
                see it despite the circumstances, which is clearly a testament
                to his rapport with other (competing) brokers. He is
                straightforward and genuine, and I truly appreciate working with
                someone whose character I value. He also encouraged me to be
                quite aggressive in the pricing for the apartment I was selling,
                despite having a direct comp (the unit below mine had sold only
                weeks before mine was listed and was more or less equivalent
                quality to mine) and the generally slower late summer market; as
                it turned out, I was able to sell at the asking price with an
                all-cash offer and even managed to get a competing offer for
                over the asking price (with financing contingency). I was
                obviously thrilled with the outcome here, which admittedly
                exceeded already high expectations. Scott is a genuinely nice
                person on top of it all and highly recommend working with
                him.&nbsp;

                We've had the pleasure of working with Scott Fava for nearly a
                decade. Throughout all our dealings we have found Scott to be a
                broker of incomparable honesty, integrity, intelligence,
                knowledge and, in our case, patience. We wholeheartedly
                recommend him.

                We had the pleasure of working with Scott on the sale of our
                apartment in Gramercy. The process of selling a co-op can be a
                stressful time and Scottâ€™s calm demeanor, knowledge of the
                market, and professionalism are valuable characteristics to have
                in a broker. He was always readily available and was a strong
                advocate for us, achieving the best outcome possible in a short
                period of time. Scott demonstrated a high attention to detail, a
                positive attitude and a sustained commitment to client
                satisfaction. We would definitely partner with Scott again to
                buy or sell an apartment in New York City.
