            testimonial: >-
                Scott has delivered for me time and time again. The sale of my
                last 'AIR loft' in SoHo was easily one of the most difficult
                feats in the history of sales in NYC real estate. He
                consistently brought through qualified prospective buyers and
                dealt with an impossibly difficult board. He never showed up
                with anything less than an extremely positive attitude and
                perseverance. I've recommended him to multiple friends and
                associates and will continue to do so.

            name: John & Cathryn
            testimonial: >-
                We have worked with the Fava Advisory on three transactions (two
                purchases and one sale) and continue to recommend Scott and his
                amazing team to other friends. Scott has keen knowledge of the
                markets as well as numerous developer contacts, which in our
                case led to us see our apartment before it was officially
                listed. Scott has high integrity and sets realistic expectations
                for purchase and sale prices so as not to mislead his clients.
                He also conducts himself in an extremely professional and detail
                oriented manner. Scott's fees have paid for themselves multiple
                times over in the form of real estate price appreciation.

            testimonial: >-
                I worked with Scott in late summer 2015 to list my apartment for
                sale (after previously working with him to purchase it back in
                2006) and to help me purchase a new apartment. The apartment I
                wanted to purchase already had an accepted offer so right out of
                the gates I was able to appreciate his ability to get me in to
                see it despite the circumstances, which is clearly a testament
                to his rapport with other (competing) brokers. He is
                straightforward and genuine, and I truly appreciate working with
                someone whose character I value. He also encouraged me to be
                quite aggressive in the pricing for the apartment I was selling,
                despite having a direct comp (the unit below mine had sold only
                weeks before mine was listed and was more or less equivalent
                quality to mine) and the generally slower late summer market; as
                it turned out, I was able to sell at the asking price with an
                all-cash offer and even managed to get a competing offer for
                over the asking price (with financing contingency). I was
                obviously thrilled with the outcome here, which admittedly
                exceeded already high expectations. Scott is a genuinely nice
                person on top of it all and highly recommend working with
                him.&nbsp;

            name: Robbie & Scott
            testimonial: >-
                We've had the pleasure of working with Scott Fava for nearly a
                decade. Throughout all our dealings we have found Scott to be a
                broker of incomparable honesty, integrity, intelligence,
                knowledge and, in our case, patience. We wholeheartedly
                recommend him.

            testimonial: >-
                We had the pleasure of working with Scott on the sale of our
                apartment in Gramercy. The process of selling a co-op can be a
                stressful time and Scott’s calm demeanor, knowledge of the
                market, and professionalism are valuable characteristics to have
                in a broker. He was always readily available and was a strong
                advocate for us, achieving the best outcome possible in a short
                period of time. Scott demonstrated a high attention to detail, a
                positive attitude and a sustained commitment to client
                satisfaction. We would definitely partner with Scott again to
                buy or sell an apartment in New York City.

            name: Pauline & Rob
            testimonial: >-
                We were referred to Scott Fava by a long time West Coast friend
                who had used Scott for several Manhattan transactions. When my
                husband was offered a wonderful opportunity in New York, we
                found ourselves with very little time to secure a home before he
                was to start his new position. To complicate the situation
                further, we were living outside the USA at the time so
                logistically we were challenged. Scott was a superstar. Before
                we even met, he had sent listings so we could narrow our search
                and also familiarize ourselves with the market. With his
                guidance, tenacity and expertise (and a lot of legwork\!\!) we
                find ourselves in our beautiful Soho loft. He negotiated the
                terms of our lease, guided us through the co-op process and
                essentially made the entire ordeal as painless as possible.

            name: Marshall
            testimonial: >-
                I was introduced to Scott through a mutual friend. It was one of
                the most fortunate introductions of my life. I wanted to move
                into Manhattan but knew very little about Manhattan real estate.
                As it turned out, Scott knew just about everything. He listened
                carefully to what I wanted and then, almost magically, was able
                to make it happen. He gently guided me through the whole process
                from beginning to end (neighborhood, building, apartment, co-op
                board interview, closing) always available, always eager to
                help. Scott is intelligent and knowledgeable as well as
                professional and personable. You quickly realize you are working
                with someone who is truly on your side, who will provide you
                with all the necessary support and expertise. Now I am happily
                living in my new home and look back on Scott more as someone who
                makes dreams come true than as a real estate broker (although
                he’s as good as it gets at that too)\!

            testimonial: >-
                The Fava Advisory played an important role in our transition
                from big city to small city. It wasn't easy to say goodbye to
                our Brooklyn home, but the time was right — as was our real
                estate team\!

            name: Grant & Claire
            testimonial: >-
                As first time New Yorkers, the search for a residence can be
                incredibly daunting. Navigating the process from search to
                signing felt like an uphill battle...until we met Scott. He
                helped us think through our priorities, search countless
                listings, ask the important questions, and make informed offers.
                At points when the process was overwhelming, he calmly partnered
                with us to guide us through the options. Ultimately we found a
                home we absolutely love and have Scott to thank for it. The
                process doesn't have to be daunting, you just need a trusted
                partner for the process - and there is no one better than Scott
                Fava.

            testimonial: >-
                Scott spent a lot of time helping me find the perfect place, and
                kept finding great spots for me to look at. In a daunting real
                estate market, he was a rock for this first-time home buyer.

                > Parrish is the definition of a consummate professional. With
                less than 12 hours notice, he arranged an offer for me in my
                dream building and diligently pursued the listing. Within 24
                hours, we had an accepted offer. Due to his tenacity,
                understanding of the market and natural drive, Parrish is the
                only salesperson I will work with in NYC to list, sell or lease.

            testimonial: >-
                Parrish always makes you feel like you’re his number 1 priority.
                Parrish is the type of real estate agent that is able to remain
                professional while also making the entire experience fun and
                stress free\! Throughout the entire process, Parrish kept a
                clear line of communication and was completely transparent with
                us about all of the properties he was showing us. Parrish took
                everything we asked for and was able to find us a home that had
                everything we wanted and more. He was always one step ahead of
                us and always had the answers to our questions or he was doing
                everything he can to get us those answers. Ever since working
                with Parrish, I’ve recommended him to everyone who is even
                considering moving in the near future, and I will continue to do
                so\!

                Parrish is the best broker I’ve ever had the pleasure of doing
                business with\! He is extremely knowledgeable about Manhattan
                and the surrounding areas, and truly puts his clients first
                above all. He is a great communicator and works diligently to
                make sure each person he works with finds their perfect home for
                them. If you’re looking for a new place to live, Parrish is the
                best person to help you make it happen.
