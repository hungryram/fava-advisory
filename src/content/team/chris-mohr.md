A savvy real estate advisor is crucial to successfully navigating the complex process of buying and selling real estate in New York City. Chris brings a strategic approach to real estate sales and works tirelessly to ensure the best possible outcome for his clients. His specialized neighborhood knowledge sets him apart from other brokers, as he spends much of his free time exploring neighborhoods throughout the city. Chris is able to sell a neighborhood just as much as real estate, which in New York City is essential to a successful sale. Additionally, his close relationships with his clients makes them feel that they are in the most caring of hands throughout the process. Any time day or night, Chris can be reached with any questions his clients may have.

Chris began his real estate career in Philadelphia prior to relocating to the Big Apple. He brings a wealth of knowledge and experience, and most importantly, a dedication to his clients. When he’s not working tirelessly for a client, you can find Chris at gallery openings, dining at the city’s newest restaurants, achieving some Zen in a hot yoga class and taking advantage of all the outdoor activities New York has to offer.
