To the far end of the extensive living space is the climatic floating stair case which takes you to the second and third levels. Perfectly designed with a sky light to accentuate the breathtaking structure and allow for warmth and light.

Just beyond the staircase separated by sliding door of Argosy steel and glass lies the rich library/den/media room featuring custom millwork, wall paneling a gas fireplace with onyx Travertine hearth, and dry bar with 15" Sub-Zero wine cooler.Also in this area is the first level bedroom suite with its own large bathroom and beautiful built in wood paneling and closet space.
